  aboutMe:
    "I'm a seasoned software engineer with over two decades of experience in the tech industry. I began my career in 2000, working across various platforms and technologies. Since 2007, when the first iPhone launched, I’ve focused exclusively on iOS development—building elegant, efficient, and scalable mobile applications for Apple’s ecosystem. Over the years, I've contributed to projects ranging from early App Store launches to modern SwiftUI-based applications, consistently staying current with Apple’s evolving frameworks and design philosophies. Whether working solo or leading a team, I take pride in writing clean code, crafting intuitive user experiences, and shipping reliable products. I'm passionate about mobile technology, and I'm always exploring ways to push the boundaries of what's possible on iOS. ",
